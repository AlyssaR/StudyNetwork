	The StudyNetwork was developed by students, for students, with the intent to connect classmates with mentors. By providing a simple to use interface, the StudyNetwork provides a lightweight and portable study group planner and organizer on the go. With a rapidly expanding community of students and study groups, StudyNetwork promises a satisfying user experience and an increased productivity closer to deadlines.
</p> 
<p>
	Created for the GUI/Database collaborative project, StudyNetwork is still being actively developed by a team of highly trained monkey-astronauts and is subject to massive, unexpected, and unannounced changes in the coming months.
